NTEE
  This program is meant to provide a command line interface into a tee program
  which connects two client and server processes.  In other words its supposed
  to act as a portal between two programs that would normally be a client and
  server.
  
  As the in-between man, ntee will forward inbound traffic outbound as well as
  record it to a file in hexidecimal format with each transmission having its
  own line and being marked by a route and time at the front of each message.
  
  Two programs were developed first to act as the client and server test programs
  then ntee was developed to act as a go-between.
  
  The idea is to make ntee a library which could be front-ended by a gui program.
  
    
Getting Started:
  1. You must have already cloned the git repo, so now your ready to build.
  2. You must have the boost C++ libraries, make, and Doxygen installed, and then
     cd into the src directory and type 'make all'.  This will build the testSrv
     and testCli (test server and client) programs in <workarea>/bin, the ntee
     library in  <workarea>/lib, and support programs, as well as run doxygen to
     generate the documentation which will be placed in 
     <workarea>/doxy/html/index.html
