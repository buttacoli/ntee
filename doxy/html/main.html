<h2><a class="anchor" id="sect_purpose">
Purpose</a></h2>
<p><b><em>ntee</em></b> is a program which acts as the unix utility tee would except for the fact that it connects two programs communicating through TCP/IP socket interfaces.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="sect_introduction">
Introduction</a></h2>
<p>This program was started as a training exercise in using the GIT versioning tool, and the GIThub public site, C++, the Boost libraries and Doxygen. The tool was thought to be useful for debugging simulation processes which communicate through sockets.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="sect_installation">
Installation</a></h2>
<p>Needs work. I would like to setup autoconf and automake, but haven't got enough experience with either to know where to start.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="sect_intentions">
Intentions</a></h2>
<p>It is my intention to develop the program to sufficient quality that it can be used to debug the simulation problems being encountered and to learn some useful lessons about distributed version control and the newer C++ libraries along the way. </p>
<p>Also a goal is to make this program stand on its own as a C++ library upon which a cool Java or Qt front end can be wrapped upon. As I've been learning, tools which have a nice look to them get a lot more consideration even if they're not really all that functional. Silly, but undeniable. </p>
